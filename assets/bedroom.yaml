This is your bedroom. It is painted in pastel colors.  It is somewhat small, but very tidy, and a gentle breeze wafts through your open window. You have a bookshelf filled with history books and a box full of various useless knicknacks and glass baubles. There is a lamp on your bedside table shaped like a star, and your favorite pen is there too. You also have several posters covering your walls of famous mages.
